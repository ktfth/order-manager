## Description

This project aim's the use of DDD on Node.js applications with TypeScript.

### Usage

You need to build first.

```sh
npm run build
```

After that you can simulate:

```sh
npm run simulate
```

And test at all.

```sh
node --test
```

## Development

For development mode, you can install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

After all, start to development your own resources. Remember the drill down of this kind of system's is to go through
small pieces like `value-objects`, `types` and `interfaces` to composable `use cases`, `repositories` and `events`.

If you like to discuss these ideas with me, send me a e-mail on `kaeyosthaeron@gmail.com`.
